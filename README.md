# gmod-spawnmenu

This is a simple recreation of Garry's Mods Spawnmenu (also known as Q-Menu) in a browser.

Simply download this project and open the index.html file.
The images for each category are saved in proplist.js.

The proplist was extracted from gmod's ingame spawnmenu (located at garrysmod/settings/spawnlist/)

The images of the props were created via a LUA panel ingame and screenshot at the highest model resolution as a 512x512 png.
